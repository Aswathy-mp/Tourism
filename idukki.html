                    Idukki Arch Dam is a double curvature parabolic architectural marvel which stands with its head held high between two huge granite hillocks. These two hillocks are popularly known as the Kuravan Mala and Kurathi Mala. The Kuravan and Kurathi were actually two tribals who were caught red-handed by Lord Rama when they were staring at Sita Devi while she was bathing in the Periyar River. And Lord Rama cursed them to become rocks. And it is believed that they became huge hillocks and the Periyar river started flowing between them. And the locals believe that the Kuravan and Kurathi got moksha when the Idukki Arch Dam was constructed between the two hills. The Idukki Dam offers an awe-inspiring view of the surrounding regions and provides a memorable boat ride through the Periyar River. Because of the mythical and architectural significance as well as the scenic beauty, the Idukki Dam is thronged by tourists all year round
