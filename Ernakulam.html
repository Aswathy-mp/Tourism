            <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">Ernakulam is a sprawling metropolis that beautifully combines its natural wonders with providing a base for a majority of the State’s business enterprises. Flanked by the Arabian sea, it is easily among the most visited locations in Kerala. It is an extremely important commercial centre but also has a plethora of destinations for tourists to enjoy. The city of Kochi, with its fine natural harbour, is the undisputed crown jewel of the district. From historic locations that transport you to a time when it acted as the commercial hub of the legendary Spice Route to exotic trips on boats where one can simply relax and soak in the weather, Kochi never disappoints. Ernakulam has always epitomized the Malayali spirit of welcoming all who visit it and this tradition continues to this day.

                  <p class="card-text" >Set foot into Fort Kochi and you will be instantly transported to a different time period. This place is steeped in the history and culture of all who have occupied it through the ages. Its roots and essence are unique in its diversity.While walking through K. J. Herschel Road, one gets a glimpse of Fort Immanuel. This former Portuguese bastion, built in 1503, is a sign of the strategic alliance between the Maharaja of Cochin and the Portuguese Monarch. Further along the road one can see the Dutch Cemetery, housing the graves of former Colonists. One can also visit St. Francis Church, the oldest European church in India. Built in 1503, it was here that the legendary explorer Vasco-da-Gama was originally buried. The Vasco-da-Gama Square is a beautiful promenade nearby where one can go for a relaxing walk. One can drop by Pierce Leslie Bungalow to view the waterfront verandas or Koder House, a fine example of the transition from colonial to Indo-European architecture.Vasco House is another must visit landmark as it is said to have been the explorer’s actual residence. It is among the oldest Portuguese buildings in Kochi. A visit to the legendary Bishop House is an enriching experience. The facade of the house has large Gothic arches and the building was acquired by Dom Jos Gomes Ferreira, the 27th Bishop of the Diocese of Cochin.</p>

                    Constituted during 1983, Dr. Salim Ali, the world famous ornithologist, is directly responsible for the wonders on display at the Thattekkad Bird Sanctuary. His famous survey of Travancore in the 1930s led to the formation of this modern day paradise for avian life. He noted that the area was rich in bird diversity and ought to be turned into a sanctuary to conserve the same. The over 300 species that reside in these tropical and deciduous forests are testament to his great vision. One can run across the Sri Lankan Frogmouth, Racket Tailed Drongo, Bronzed Drongo, White-bellied Treepie, Shama, Yellow-browed Bulbul, Rufous Babbler, Malabar Parakeet, White-bellied Blue Flycatcher and the Malabar Grey Hornbill in these parts. Beautiful teak, rosewood and mahogany plantations can also be viewed here. It also boasts of over 28 mammal species and over 9 species of reptiles.

                    Kumbalangi Integrated Tourism Village Project is a unique initiative to transform the tiny island of Kumbalangi into a model fishing village and tourism spot. It is the first of its kind in India and is located in Kochi. It is blessed with many natural wonders and the people who visits are treated to many a rare treat. Kumbalangi is surrounded by backwaters.  Chinese Fishing Nets cover the island and the village boasts of rich aquatic life. An array of mangroves separate land from water and provide for a good breeding ground for prawns, crabs, oysters and small fish. Palluruthy nearby is coming up in a similar manner. This hamlet provides a close glimpse of the simple lifestyle of villagers who still live by traditions that have been passed down for centuries.Kalagramam is an artist’s village that displays fishing equipment and handicrafts. Bait-fishing is extremely popular among tourists here. Many houses in the village are homestays and visitors can book their stay directly with homestay operators.

                        Once destroyed during incessant Portuguese shelling, the Mattancherry Synagogue is among the most historically relevant locations in Fort Kochi. The oldest synagogue in the Commonwealth, it was built in 1568.  Also known as the Paradesi Synagogue, it receives several thousand visitors every year from all over the world. People flock to Jew Street to catch a glimpse of this architecture and the lineage of the Jews who still follow the old customs. Walk in and you're greeted by mid-18th century hand-painted and willow patterned floor tiles from China, a clock tower, Hebrew inscriptions on stone slabs, great scrolls of the Old Testament and ancient scripts on copper plates in which grants of privilege were made by the former Cochin rulers. The area around the synagogue is a centre of spice trade and curio shops. It is a beautiful destination, with memories of the past floating around in every single corner.

                    Located about 10 kms from Kochi, the Hill Palace Museum was the official residence of the erstwhile rulers of Kochi. Built in 1865, it is now famous for being a full-fledged Ethno-Archaeological Museum and Kerala's first-ever Heritage Museum. The palace complex itself comprises 49 buildings and is built in the traditional Kerala style of architecture. It has over 52 acres of terraced land around it. One can see oil paintings, murals, sculptures, manuscripts and belongings of the Kochi royal family. Antique ceramics from the Far East, Kudakkallu  (tombstone), Thoppikkallu (hood stone), laterite memorials and wooden memorials from ancient civilisations like the Indus Valley and Harappa can also be found here. It even has a gallery housing contemporary art. It is our pride to have relics of such value and significance placed here.
