It has 10 Ecotourism spots that cover the great hill ranges of Thiruvananthapuram, Pathanamthitta and Kollam districts. ‘Thenmala’ translates to 'Honey Hill' and so it is no surprise that high quality honey is exported from this area. The surrounding dense forest is also known for the timber that is in much demand across the country. Its terrain is dotted by forests, rubber and tree plantations and was selected by the World Tourism Organisation as one of the premier eco-friendly projects in the world.The Nakshatravanam, a nursery of trees that are considered sacred to the 27 constellations, has people thronging to it to take home a sapling of the tree related to their own birth star. A visit to the nearby Deer Rehabilitation Centre is a must as various species of deer are bred here. They are released into the forest when the population reaches optimum levels. A boat ride in the majestic Shendurney Wildlife Sanctuary caps off a memorable trip to Thenmala. The rare flora and fauna on display are truly exquisite and will remain etched in your memory forever.

                    Palaruvi Falls, cascading downstream from the height of 300 ft, is one of the prime attractions in Kutrallam or as some call it Courtallam, Tamil Nadu. Owing to its height; it is the 32nd highest fall in our country. The name Palaruvi means 'Stream of Milk' in the regional language. Ironically it seems to be a glittering stream of milk as it flows down. Hence, the beauty of this fall stands unimaginable till witnessed with own eyes. The roaring sounds of the fall stand in stark contrast to the silence of the forests and mist-kissed mountains around it.
