                    The Kadammanitta Devi Temple is famous for the ten-day long Patayani performances held in connection with the annual festival in April/May. Kadammanitta is famous for the Patayani performance at the Devi temple here, which is a burst of colour, energy and passionate devotion. The festival is celebrated every year from the first day of Malayalam month medam to the 10th day, called the pathamudayam.The celebration begins by lighting a sacred lamp from the temple – a ritual called chootu vaipu, which is followed by the drumming of traditional percussions thappu and chenda. The following nine days are marked by lively processions in which the artists donning life-size masks, resembling mythological characters perform on traditional Padayani songs. The vibrant masks are an intricate craftwork made of areca spathes and palm leaves arranged creatively.Main attraction of the festival is the eighth day when the various kolam performances- a Ganapathi Kolam, four Marutha Kolams, one Kalan Kolam, eight Yakshi Kolam, Kanjiramala and Bharavi Kolams, are scheduled together. These theatrical musings also have comical interludes with, Pradeshi being the most famous. The festival also incorporates some unique traditions like mounting a Palmyra tree and pushing it down after performing some rituals on the sixth day. The ceremonial dance-Padayani, performed at the festival is a traditional folk dance and a ritual art unique to the former kingdom of Travancore. This flamboyant art form is often regarded as a remnant of the Dravidian forms of worship that existed before the advent of Brahmanism in the state.

                    Vallasadya is a ritualistic feast, done as a vazhipadu (offering) by the devotees to Lord Krishna, the presiding deity at the Sree Parthasarathy temple.The devotee who offers the vazhipadu invites the crew of the snake-boat or Palliyodam of his choice to partake in the Vallasadya. Each snake-boat represents a region close to the village of Aranmula. The feast is held in the outer quadrangle of the Sree Parthasarathy temple, inside traditional dining halls called Oottupura. In Kerala, Oottupura is part of palace structures and temples used for giving food to people who work there and to the common public on special occasions.As part of the Vallasadya the crew of the selected snake-boat will be accorded a customary reception on their arrival to the temple ghat. They circumambulate the temple, singing Vanchippattu, songs of the boatmen in praise of Lord Parthasarathy, before being led to the temple Oottupura (dining hall) for the feast. As the feast progresses, the guests demand more rice and dishes by singing in the same style as that of Vanchippattu. This generates an ambience filled with fun, hurried activities and a flow of energy that is unique to Vallasadya. As many as 50 to 64 items are usually served during the course of this sumptuous feast.
