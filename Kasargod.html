                  <p class="card-text" >Around 16 km to the south of northernmost district in Kerala, Kasaragod, lies the massive Bekal Fort. It is among the biggest forts in Kerala and has been impeccably maintained throughout the years. It rises to 130 feet above sea level and is situated on a headland spanning 35km. Much effort has been put to develop a beautiful beach here called the Bekal Fort Beach. People flock to these spots in great numbers. Situated comfortably on steep hills by the sea, the fort provides for an imposing view from the beach. Built using laterite slabs and with a polygonal shape, it is amongst the most visited sites in Kerala. There are many factors that have added to the popularity of the site. An observation tower fitted with beautiful peepholes, the Anjaneya Temple with its famous masonry and two Theyyam sculptures built from laterite are among the primary attractions. An ancient mosque built by Tipu Sultan and various underground passageways are also important places in the area. A rock garden was built using laterite in the parking area and is an architectural marvel in itself. Trees have been planted on the beach along with the construction of a splendid walkway which makes it easier to traverse the beach and enjoy its sights. At night, the entire place is lit up with special lights that add a whole new dimension to its beauty.</p>

                    A true natural beauty, Ranipuram is consistently eulogised for its vast green attractions - vistas of sprawling grasslands and hills, being the most captivating among them. Exhibiting as it does the breathtaking beauty of the mighty Western Ghats, this is one the most sought-after travel destinations in north Kerala that welcomes travellers, come rain or shine! Ranipuram, popularly known as the Ooty of Kerala, is situated 750 m above sea level in Kasaragod district. On one side of the lush green meadows lies Karnataka, sprawling up to the horizon, and on the other side, Kerala, that vast stretch of picturesque landscape limited only by an expanse of the ocean.The trail paved with black stones leads you into the dark and misty woods. Where the steps end, the woods engulf you from all sides with its wildness. The early morning sun can hardly penetrate the thick canopy and you shuffle along in partial darkness, leaning on your stick for support, and sometimes pulling yourself up with the help of thick, sturdy roots, some large-hearted trees throw your way. The fencing along the trail gives you the chills as you realize how close you could be to a tusker in the darkness. An hour of this adventurous trek will lead you the limitless green meadows of Shola grasslands. Ranipuram is blessed with rare medicinal plants, as well as pretty orchids, and is also home to animals like wild boars, deer and monkeys.

                        The historic Malik Deenar Juma Masjid built in the typical Kerala style is believed to have been founded by Malik Ibn Deenar. The mosque, Juma Masjid, which is one of the best kept and most attractive in the district, is located at Thalankara. Malik bin Deenar or Malik Ibn Dinar was a Tabi‘in who is famous for being the first to bring Islam to India. In 624 AD, Malik Ibn Deenar and 12 of his trade associates landed in Kerala. Their mission was not just trade but to propagate Islam in other parts of the world. The delegation consisted of Sharaf Ibn Malik, his brother Malik Ibn Deenar and his nephew Malik Ibn Habeeb Ibn Malik.  The mission reached at Kanhirakode (now Kasaragod).  Their distinct way of trade and the propagation of Islam soon attracted the attention of the then ruler Cheraman Perumal. On enquiry, Malik Bin Deenar and his comrades related the reason for their honest trade practices to be their recent conversion to Islam. Soon the king was fascinated by the doctrines of this new religion which prompted him to embrace Islam.
