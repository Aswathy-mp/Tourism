Cradled by the backwaters and the Western Ghats, it is epitomised by its stretches of vast greenery, paddy fields and huge rubber plantations. Over five of the State’s leading newspaper publications originate from Kottayam. About four-fifth of books published in the State come from here as well. From trekking hotbeds like Nadukani and Kottathavalam to the rare avian life on display at the Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary, this district encompasses everything that God’s Own Country is famous for. Well connected to the entire State, it is full of interesting historical and cultural locations that tell the tale of how the district was forged into its current form.

                  <p class="card-text" >One of the most popular tourist destinations in Kottayam district is Illickal Kallu, situated on a majestic hill called Illickal Mala. There are numerous mountain streams in Illickal Mala, which is 6,000 ft above sea level, and they flow down to form the serene Meenachil River. Each of the three hills has a peculiar shape. One of them resembles a mushroom and hence, its name ‘Kuda Kallu’ (umbrella-shaped rock). The second hill has a small hunch on the side and is therefore called as ‘Koonu Kallu’ (hunchback rock). The third one is called Illickal Kallu as it derives its name from the mountain itself. The steep rock on the top of the hill has a part of its peak shorn off. There is a 1⁄2-foot-wide bridge called Narakapalam (bridge to hell) connecting these two hills. The beauty and the landscape of illikkal kallu is similar to that of the pillar rocks in Kodaikanal. It is said that the mythical medicinal herb Neela Koduveli grows here. This mythical blue flower is also believed to possess supernatural powers, which could increase wealth and ensure a rich harvest.From the hilltops, the Arabian Sea can be seen on the far horizon as a thin blue stroke. The view of the sunset from above the peak in the evening of a full moon day can be sensational, the moon can be seen rising up like another sun, as the orange sun goes down.
